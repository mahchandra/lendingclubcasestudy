## General Information
- A Finance company specializing in distribution of various type of loan consolidated data to understand customers who are likely to default from paying back the loan
- When a customer is provided a loan, he needs to repay the loan amount in installments with some interest on the remaining amount
- If customer is defaulting from the loan, that means customer fails to repay the company and company has to incur the loss
- To overcome with this problem, company collected loan data for couple of years and is trying to understand the customers better so we can filter people who can default before even registering for the loan
